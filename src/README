ISPELL-ET -- Estonian dictionaries for ispell and myspell
---------------------------------------------------------
Homepage:  http://www.meso.ee/~jjpp/speller/

Wordlists
---------
The wordlists are based on work by the Institute of the Estonian Language,
subsequently improved by Jaak Pruulmann who also created the affix file.

Hyphenation pattern
-------------------
The hyphenation pattern was created by Enn Saar for utilization with LaTeX 
and downloaded from:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hyphenation/eehyph.tex

It was then converted to the OpenOffice format by Jaak Pruulmann.

Encoding issues
---------------
All dictionaries are encoded in the ISO-8859-15 (Latin-9) character-set,
which is absolutely necessary to accommodate the plethora of foreign words
featuring S- and Z-caron that see daily usage in the Estonian language.

Dictionaries to accomodate the ISO-8859-1 legacy encoding still used on 
some operating systems are also included for completion, but obviously
won't successfully proofread words that use S and Z with a caron accent.

Wordlist improvement
--------------------
Corrections to existing words and suggestions for new words are welcome.
Please send them to the author for inclusion in the next revision.
